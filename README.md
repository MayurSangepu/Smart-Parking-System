# Smart-Parking-System

As the user interface, created a mobile application, as well as a parking system that shows and allows the user to book parking spots in a parking garage, saving the user time and increasing the precision of finding a parking place. C++ was used to code and control the RaspberryPi board, which is linked to all of the IR sensors in the parking garage and transfers this data to the mobile application.
